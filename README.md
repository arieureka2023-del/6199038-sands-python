# Signals and Systems

This repository represents the project I completed for the **Signals and Systems AESB2122-24** course.

---

## Introduction
The project focuses on generating basic signals using functions in Python to manipulate, plot and analyze different types of signals, such as sine wave and unit step functions.

## Content
- `hello.py` – First print statement, testing 
- `Signals.py` – Defines the signals (`generate_u`and `generate_sin_wave`)  
- `Run.py` – Modifies and plots the signals   
- `README.md` – Presents the project
