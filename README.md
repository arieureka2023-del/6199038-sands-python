Signals and Systems practical

This repository contains the practical work I completed for the Signals and Systems course. 
The project focuses on generating basic signals using functions in Python to manipulate, plot and analyze different types of signals. 
The code is organized into two main files: Signals.py, which includes the functions used to create various signals (such as a unit-step function, and a sine wave function), and run.py, where these signals are modified and plotted. 
The repository serves as a collection of the exercises and solutions developed during this practical.
